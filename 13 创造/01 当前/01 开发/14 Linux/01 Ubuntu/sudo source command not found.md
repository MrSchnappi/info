# sudo source :command not found


之前想用 sudo source ~/.bashrc 来刷新环境变量的时候，提示说：`sudo source: command not found`


The problem is that `source` is a bash build-in command (not a program - like `ls` or `grep`). I think one approach is to login as root and then execute the source command.

```bsh
sudo -s
source /etc/bash.bashrc
```
