# AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION PACKAGE - TORCH.AUTOGRAD

`torch.autograd` provides classes and functions implementing automatic differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions. It requires minimal changes to the existing code - you only need to declare `Tensor` s for which gradients should be computed with the `requires_grad=True` keyword.

- `torch.autograd.``backward`(*tensors*, *grad_tensors=None*, *retain_graph=None*, *create_graph=False*, *grad_variables=None*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd.html#backward)

  Computes the sum of gradients of given tensors w.r.t. graph leaves.The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If any of `tensors` are non-scalar (i.e. their data has more than one element) and require gradient, then the Jacobian-vector product would be computed, in this case the function additionally requires specifying `grad_tensors`. It should be a sequence of matching length, that contains the “vector” in the Jacobian-vector product, usually the gradient of the differentiated function w.r.t. corresponding tensors (`None` is an acceptable value for all tensors that don’t need gradient tensors).This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero them before calling it.Parameters**tensors** (*sequence of Tensor*) – Tensors of which the derivative will be computed.**grad_tensors** (*sequence of* *(*[*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor) *or* [*None*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None)*)*) – The “vector” in the Jacobian-vector product, usually gradients w.r.t. each element of corresponding tensors. None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don’t require grad. If a None value would be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this argument is optional.**retain_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `False`, the graph used to compute the grad will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to `True` is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient way. Defaults to the value of `create_graph`.**create_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `True`, graph of the derivative will be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products. Defaults to `False`.

- `torch.autograd.``grad`(*outputs*, *inputs*, *grad_outputs=None*, *retain_graph=None*, *create_graph=False*, *only_inputs=True*, *allow_unused=False*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd.html#grad)

  Computes and returns the sum of gradients of outputs w.r.t. the inputs.`grad_outputs` should be a sequence of length matching `output` containing the “vector” in Jacobian-vector product, usually the pre-computed gradients w.r.t. each of the outputs. If an output doesn’t require_grad, then the gradient can be `None`).If `only_inputs` is `True`, the function will only return a list of gradients w.r.t the specified inputs. If it’s `False`, then gradient w.r.t. all remaining leaves will still be computed, and will be accumulated into their `.grad` attribute.Parameters**outputs** (*sequence of Tensor*) – outputs of the differentiated function.**inputs** (*sequence of Tensor*) – Inputs w.r.t. which the gradient will be returned (and not accumulated into `.grad`).**grad_outputs** (*sequence of Tensor*) – The “vector” in the Jacobian-vector product. Usually gradients w.r.t. each output. None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don’t require grad. If a None value would be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this argument is optional. Default: None.**retain_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `False`, the graph used to compute the grad will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to `True` is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient way. Defaults to the value of `create_graph`.**create_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `True`, graph of the derivative will be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products. Default: `False`.**allow_unused** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `False`, specifying inputs that were not used when computing outputs (and therefore their grad is always zero) is an error. Defaults to `False`.



## Locally disabling gradient computation

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.``no_grad`[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/grad_mode.html#no_grad)

  Context-manager that disabled gradient calculation.Disabling gradient calculation is useful for inference, when you are sure that you will not call `Tensor.backward()`. It will reduce memory consumption for computations that would otherwise have requires_grad=True. In this mode, the result of every computation will haverequires_grad=False, even when the inputs have requires_grad=True.Also functions as a decorator.Example:`>>> x = torch.tensor([1], requires_grad=True) >>> with torch.no_grad(): ...   y = x * 2 >>> y.requires_grad False >>> @torch.no_grad() ... def doubler(x): ...     return x * 2 >>> z = doubler(x) >>> z.requires_grad False `

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.``enable_grad`[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/grad_mode.html#enable_grad)

  Context-manager that enables gradient calculation.Enables gradient calculation inside a [`no_grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.no_grad) context. This has no effect outside of [`no_grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.no_grad).Also functions as a decorator.Example:`>>> x = torch.tensor([1], requires_grad=True) >>> with torch.no_grad(): ...   with torch.enable_grad(): ...     y = x * 2 >>> y.requires_grad True >>> y.backward() >>> x.grad >>> @torch.enable_grad() ... def doubler(x): ...     return x * 2 >>> with torch.no_grad(): ...     z = doubler(x) >>> z.requires_grad True `

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.``set_grad_enabled`(*mode*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/grad_mode.html#set_grad_enabled)

  Context-manager that sets gradient calculation to on or off.`set_grad_enabled` will enable or disable grads based on its argument `mode`. It can be used as a context-manager or as a function.Parameters**mode** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)) – Flag whether to enable grad (`True`), or disable (`False`). This can be used to conditionally enable gradients.Example:`>>> x = torch.tensor([1], requires_grad=True) >>> is_train = False >>> with torch.set_grad_enabled(is_train): ...   y = x * 2 >>> y.requires_grad False >>> torch.set_grad_enabled(True) >>> y = x * 2 >>> y.requires_grad True >>> torch.set_grad_enabled(False) >>> y = x * 2 >>> y.requires_grad False `

## In-place operations on Tensors

Supporting in-place operations in autograd is a hard matter, and we discourage their use in most cases. Autograd’s aggressive buffer freeing and reuse makes it very efficient and there are very few occasions when in-place operations actually lower memory usage by any significant amount. Unless you’re operating under heavy memory pressure, you might never need to use them.

### In-place correctness checks

All `Tensor` s keep track of in-place operations applied to them, and if the implementation detects that a tensor was saved for backward in one of the functions, but it was modified in-place afterwards, an error will be raised once backward pass is started. This ensures that if you’re using in-place functions and not seeing any errors, you can be sure that the computed gradients are correct.

## Variable (deprecated)

WARNING

The Variable API has been deprecated: Variables are no longer necessary to use autograd with tensors. Autograd automatically supports Tensors with `requires_grad` set to `True`. Below please find a quick guide on what has changed:

- `Variable(tensor)` and `Variable(tensor, requires_grad)` still work as expected, but they return Tensors instead of Variables.
- `var.data` is the same thing as `tensor.data`.
- Methods such as `var.backward(), var.detach(), var.register_hook()` now work on tensors with the same method names.

In addition, one can now create tensors with `requires_grad=True` using factory methods such as [`torch.randn()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.randn), [`torch.zeros()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.zeros), [`torch.ones()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.ones), and others like the following:

```
autograd_tensor = torch.randn((2, 3, 4), requires_grad=True)
```

## Tensor autograd functions

- *CLASS*`torch.``Tensor`

  `backward`(*gradient=None*, *retain_graph=None*, *create_graph=False*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/tensor.html#Tensor.backward)Computes the gradient of current tensor w.r.t. graph leaves.The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If the tensor is non-scalar (i.e. its data has more than one element) and requires gradient, the function additionally requires specifying `gradient`. It should be a tensor of matching type and location, that contains the gradient of the differentiated function w.r.t. `self`.This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero them before calling it.Parameters**gradient** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor) *or* [*None*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None)) – Gradient w.r.t. the tensor. If it is a tensor, it will be automatically converted to a Tensor that does not require grad unless `create_graph` is True. None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don’t require grad. If a None value would be acceptable then this argument is optional.**retain_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `False`, the graph used to compute the grads will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to True is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient way. Defaults to the value of `create_graph`.**create_graph** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – If `True`, graph of the derivative will be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products. Defaults to `False`.`detach`()Returns a new Tensor, detached from the current graph.The result will never require gradient.NOTEReturned Tensor shares the same storage with the original one. In-place modifications on either of them will be seen, and may trigger errors in correctness checks. IMPORTANT NOTE: Previously, in-place size / stride / storage changes (such as resize_ / resize_as_ / set_ / transpose_) to the returned tensor also update the original tensor. Now, these in-place changes will not update the original tensor anymore, and will instead trigger an error. For sparse tensors: In-place indices / values changes (such as zero_ / copy_ / add_) to the returned tensor will not update the original tensor anymore, and will instead trigger an error.`detach_`()Detaches the Tensor from the graph that created it, making it a leaf. Views cannot be detached in-place.`grad`This attribute is `None` by default and becomes a Tensor the first time a call to [`backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.backward)computes gradients for `self`. The attribute will then contain the gradients computed and future calls to [`backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.backward) will accumulate (add) gradients into it.`is_leaf`All Tensors that have [`requires_grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.requires_grad) which is `False` will be leaf Tensors by convention.For Tensors that have [`requires_grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.requires_grad) which is `True`, they will be leaf Tensors if they were created by the user. This means that they are not the result of an operation and so`grad_fn` is None.Only leaf Tensors will have their [`grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.grad) populated during a call to [`backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.backward). To get [`grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.grad)populated for non-leaf Tensors, you can use [`retain_grad()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.retain_grad).Example:`>>> a = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True) >>> a.is_leaf True >>> b = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True).cuda() >>> b.is_leaf False # b was created by the operation that cast a cpu Tensor into a cuda Tensor >>> c = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True) + 2 >>> c.is_leaf False # c was created by the addition operation >>> d = torch.rand(10).cuda() >>> d.is_leaf True # d does not require gradients and so has no operation creating it (that is tracked by the autograd engine) >>> e = torch.rand(10).cuda().requires_grad_() >>> e.is_leaf True # e requires gradients and has no operations creating it >>> f = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True, device="cuda") >>> f.is_leaf True # f requires grad, has no operation creating it ``register_hook`(*hook*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/tensor.html#Tensor.register_hook)Registers a backward hook.The hook will be called every time a gradient with respect to the Tensor is computed. The hook should have the following signature:`hook(grad) -> Tensor or None `The hook should not modify its argument, but it can optionally return a new gradient which will be used in place of [`grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.grad).This function returns a handle with a method `handle.remove()` that removes the hook from the module.Example:`>>> v = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0.], requires_grad=True) >>> h = v.register_hook(lambda grad: grad * 2)  # double the gradient >>> v.backward(torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])) >>> v.grad   2  4  6 [torch.FloatTensor of size (3,)]  >>> h.remove()  # removes the hook ``requires_grad`Is `True` if gradients need to be computed for this Tensor, `False` otherwise.NOTEThe fact that gradients need to be computed for a Tensor do not mean that the [`grad`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.grad) attribute will be populated, see [`is_leaf`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.is_leaf) for more details.`retain_grad`()[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/tensor.html#Tensor.retain_grad)Enables .grad attribute for non-leaf Tensors.

## Function

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.``Function`[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/function.html#Function)

  Records operation history and defines formulas for differentiating ops.Every operation performed on `Tensor` s creates a new function object, that performs the computation, and records that it happened. The history is retained in the form of a DAG of functions, with edges denoting data dependencies (`input <- output`). Then, when backward is called, the graph is processed in the topological ordering, by calling [`backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.backward) methods of each [`Function`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function) object, and passing returned gradients on to next [`Function`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function) s.Normally, the only way users interact with functions is by creating subclasses and defining new operations. This is a recommended way of extending torch.autograd.Each function object is meant to be used only once (in the forward pass).Examples:`>>> class Exp(Function): >>> >>>     @staticmethod >>>     def forward(ctx, i): >>>         result = i.exp() >>>         ctx.save_for_backward(result) >>>         return result >>> >>>     @staticmethod >>>     def backward(ctx, grad_output): >>>         result, = ctx.saved_tensors >>>         return grad_output * result `*STATIC* `backward`(*ctx*, **grad_outputs*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/function.html#Function.backward)Defines a formula for differentiating the operation.This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.It must accept a context `ctx` as the first argument, followed by as many outputs did [`forward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function.forward) return, and it should return as many tensors, as there were inputs to [`forward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function.forward). Each argument is the gradient w.r.t the given output, and each returned value should be the gradient w.r.t. the corresponding input.The context can be used to retrieve tensors saved during the forward pass. It also has an attribute `ctx.needs_input_grad` as a tuple of booleans representing whether each input needs gradient. E.g., [`backward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.backward) will have `ctx.needs_input_grad[0] = True` if the first input to [`forward()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function.forward) needs gradient computated w.r.t. the output.*STATIC* `forward`(*ctx*, **args*, **\*kwargs*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/function.html#Function.forward)Performs the operation.This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.It must accept a context ctx as the first argument, followed by any number of arguments (tensors or other types).The context can be used to store tensors that can be then retrieved during the backward pass.



## Numerical gradient checking

- `torch.autograd.``gradcheck`(*func*, *inputs*, *eps=1e-06*, *atol=1e-05*, *rtol=0.001*, *raise_exception=True*, *check_sparse_nnz=False*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/gradcheck.html#gradcheck)

  Check gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical gradients w.r.t. tensors in `inputs` that are of floating point type and with `requires_grad=True`.The check between numerical and analytical gradients uses [`allclose()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.allclose).NOTEThe default values are designed for `input` of double precision. This check will likely fail if `input` is of less precision, e.g., `FloatTensor`.WARNINGIf any checked tensor in `input` has overlapping memory, i.e., different indices pointing to the same memory address (e.g., from `torch.expand()`), this check will likely fail because the numerical gradients computed by point perturbation at such indices will change values at all other indices that share the same memory address.Parameters**func** (*function*) – a python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns a Tensor or a tuple of Tensors**inputs** (*tuple of Tensor* *or* [*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – inputs to the function**eps** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – perturbation for finite differences**atol** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – absolute tolerance**rtol** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – relative tolerance**raise_exception** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – indicating whether to raise an exception if the check fails. The exception gives more information about the exact nature of the failure. This is helpful when debugging gradchecks.**check_sparse_nnz** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – if True, gradcheck allows for SparseTensor input, and for any SparseTensor at input, gradcheck will perform check at nnz positions only.ReturnsTrue if all differences satisfy allclose condition

- `torch.autograd.``gradgradcheck`(*func*, *inputs*, *grad_outputs=None*, *eps=1e-06*, *atol=1e-05*, *rtol=0.001*, *gen_non_contig_grad_outputs=False*, *raise_exception=True*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/gradcheck.html#gradgradcheck)

  Check gradients of gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical gradients w.r.t. tensors in `inputs` and `grad_outputs` that are of floating point type and with `requires_grad=True`.This function checks that backpropagating through the gradients computed to the given `grad_outputs` are correct.The check between numerical and analytical gradients uses [`allclose()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.allclose).NOTEThe default values are designed for `input` and `grad_outputs` of double precision. This check will likely fail if they are of less precision, e.g., `FloatTensor`.WARNINGIf any checked tensor in `input` and `grad_outputs` has overlapping memory, i.e., different indices pointing to the same memory address (e.g., from `torch.expand()`), this check will likely fail because the numerical gradients computed by point perturbation at such indices will change values at all other indices that share the same memory address.Parameters**func** (*function*) – a python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns a Tensor or a tuple of Tensors**inputs** (*tuple of Tensor* *or* [*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – inputs to the function**grad_outputs** (*tuple of Tensor* *or* [*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)*,* *optional*) – The gradients with respect to the function’s outputs.**eps** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – perturbation for finite differences**atol** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – absolute tolerance**rtol** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float)*,* *optional*) – relative tolerance**gen_non_contig_grad_outputs** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – if `grad_outputs` is `None` and `gen_non_contig_grad_outputs` is `True`, the randomly generated gradient outputs are made to be noncontiguous**raise_exception** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – indicating whether to raise an exception if the check fails. The exception gives more information about the exact nature of the failure. This is helpful when debugging gradchecks.ReturnsTrue if all differences satisfy allclose condition

## Profiler

Autograd includes a profiler that lets you inspect the cost of different operators inside your model - both on the CPU and GPU. There are two modes implemented at the moment - CPU-only using [`profile`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.profiler.profile). and nvprof based (registers both CPU and GPU activity) using [`emit_nvtx`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx).

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.profiler.``profile`(*enabled=True*, *use_cuda=False*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/profiler.html#profile)

  Context manager that manages autograd profiler state and holds a summary of results.Parameters**enabled** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – Setting this to False makes this context manager a no-op. Default: `True`.**use_cuda** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – Enables timing of CUDA events as well using the cudaEvent API. Adds approximately 4us of overhead to each tensor operation.

- *CLASS*`torch.autograd.profiler.``emit_nvtx`(*enabled=True*)[[SOURCE\]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/autograd/profiler.html#emit_nvtx)

  Context manager that makes every autograd operation emit an NVTX range.It is useful when running the program under nvprof:`nvprof --profile-from-start off -o trace_name.prof -- <regular command here> `Unfortunately, there’s no way to force nvprof to flush the data it collected to disk, so for CUDA profiling one has to use this context manager to annotate nvprof traces and wait for the process to exit before inspecting them. Then, either NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvvp) can be used to visualize the timeline, or [`torch.autograd.profiler.load_nvprof()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.profiler.load_nvprof) can load the results for inspection e.g. in python REPL.Parameters**enabled** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)*,* *optional*) – Setting this to False makes this context manager a no-op. Default: `True`.Example`>>> with torch.cuda.profiler.profile(): ...     model(x) # Warmup CUDA memory allocator and profiler ...     with torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx(): ...         model(x) `**Forward-backward correlation**When viewing a profile created using [`emit_nvtx`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx) in the Nvidia Visual Profiler, correlating each backward-pass op with the corresponding forward-pass op can be difficult. To ease this task, [`emit_nvtx`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx) appends sequence number information to the ranges it generates.During the forward pass, each function range is decorated with `seq=<N>`. `seq` is a running counter, incremented each time a new backward Function object is created and stashed for backward. Thus, the seq=<N> annotation associated with each forward function range tells you that if a backward Function object is created by this forward function, the backward object will receive sequence number N. During the backward pass, the top-level range wrapping each c++ backward Function’s`apply()` call is decorated with `stashed seq=<M>`. `M` is the sequence number that the backward object was created with. By comparing `stashed seq` numbers in backward with `seq` numbers in forward, you can track down which forward op created each backward Function.Any functions executed during the backward pass are also decorated with `seq=<N>`. During default backward (with `create_graph=False`) this information is irrelevant, and in fact, `N` may simply be 0 for all such functions. Only the top-level ranges associated with backward Function objects’ `apply()` methods are useful, as a way to correlate these Function objects with the earlier forward pass.**Double-backward**If, on the other hand, a backward pass with `create_graph=True` is underway (in other words, if you are setting up for a double-backward), each function’s execution during backward is given a nonzero, useful `seq=<N>`. Those functions may themselves create Function objects to be executed later during double-backward, just as the original functions in the forward pass did. The relationship between backward and double-backward is conceptually the same as the relationship between forward and backward: The functions still emit current-sequence-number-tagged ranges, the Function objects they create still stash those sequence numbers, and during the eventual double-backward, the Function objects’ `apply()` ranges are still tagged with `stashed seq` numbers, which can be compared to seq numbers from the backward pass.

## Anomaly detection

  Context-manager that enable anomaly detection for the autograd engine.This does two things: - Running the forward pass with detection enabled will allow the backward pass to print the traceback of the forward operation that created the failing backward function. - Any backward computation that generate “nan” value will raise an error.Example`>>> import torch >>> from torch import autograd >>> class MyFunc(autograd.Function): ...     @staticmethod ...     def forward(ctx, inp): ...         return inp.clone() ...     @staticmethod ...     def backward(ctx, gO): ...         # Error during the backward pass ...         raise RuntimeError("Some error in backward") ...         return gO.clone() >>> def run_fn(a): ...     out = MyFunc.apply(a) ...     return out.sum() >>> inp = torch.rand(10, 10, requires_grad=True) >>> out = run_fn(inp) >>> out.backward()     Traceback (most recent call last):       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/tensor.py", line 93, in backward         torch.autograd.backward(self, gradient, retain_graph, create_graph)       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/autograd/__init__.py", line 90, in backward         allow_unreachable=True)  # allow_unreachable flag       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/autograd/function.py", line 76, in apply         return self._forward_cls.backward(self, *args)       File "<stdin>", line 8, in backward     RuntimeError: Some error in backward >>> with autograd.detect_anomaly(): ...     inp = torch.rand(10, 10, requires_grad=True) ...     out = run_fn(inp) ...     out.backward()     Traceback of forward call that caused the error:       File "tmp.py", line 53, in <module>         out = run_fn(inp)       File "tmp.py", line 44, in run_fn         out = MyFunc.apply(a)     Traceback (most recent call last):       File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/tensor.py", line 93, in backward         torch.autograd.backward(self, gradient, retain_graph, create_graph)       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/autograd/__init__.py", line 90, in backward         allow_unreachable=True)  # allow_unreachable flag       File "/your/pytorch/install/torch/autograd/function.py", line 76, in apply         return self._forward_cls.backward(self, *args)       File "<stdin>", line 8, in backward     RuntimeError: Some error in backward `

  Context-manager that sets the anomaly detection for the autograd engine on or off.`set_detect_anomaly` will enable or disable the autograd anomaly detection based on its argument `mode`. It can be used as a context-manager or as a function.See `detect_anomaly` above for details of the anomaly detection behaviour.Parameters**mode** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)) – Flag whether to enable anomaly detection (`True`), or disable (`False`).
